## Land Value Tax
(Modification)
In the Big 3 cities, represent approximate impacts of switching from the current property tax system to one which achieves the same income but only from taxing the value of the land value (and not the structure value). Could we approach this: every so many more percent lower the improvement-to-land ratio is, profitability on a new structure rises 1%? 

Assume an acre of land is worth $33.3m in SF, $7.8m in San Jose, and $5.4m in Oakland. Only apply to land zoned for HM:
